# Health Check Implementation & Safety Measures

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive health checks, CI/CD pipeline, and safety measures implemented to ensure code quality and prevent issues.

## A) Health Check Script (`scripts/healthcheck.sh`)

### Purpose
- Scans for critical file issues
- Runs git integrity checks
- Identifies extremely large files
- Ensures critical files exist and are readable

### Features
- **Git Integrity**: Runs `git fsck --full` to check repository health
- **Critical File Check**: Verifies essential files exist and are readable
- **Large File Detection**: Identifies files >10MB that might cause issues
- **macOS APFS Compatible**: Designed to work with macOS file system quirks

### Critical Files Monitored
- `package.json`
- `tsconfig.json`
- `backend/tsconfig.json`
- `app/_layout.tsx`
- `backend/server.ts`

### Usage
```bash
# Run manually
./scripts/healthcheck.sh

# Run via npm script
npm run prepush:guard
```

## B) Pre-Push Guards

### Husky Integration
- **Pre-push Hook**: Automatically runs health checks before any push
- **Location**: `.husky/pre-push`
- **Script**: `npm run prepush:guard`

### Package.json Scripts
```json
{
  "prepush:guard": "./scripts/healthcheck.sh",
  "typecheck": "tsc -p backend/tsconfig.json --noEmit && tsc -p tsconfig.json --noEmit"
}
```

## C) GitHub Actions CI

### Workflow File: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

### Triggers
- Push to any branch
- Pull requests

### Jobs
1. **Build Job** (Ubuntu Latest)
   - Checkout code
   - Setup Node.js 20
   - Install dependencies (`npm ci`)
   - Run health check script
   - Run Expo doctor
   - Run TypeScript type checking

### Benefits
- Ensures all contributors run the same checks
- Catches issues before they reach main branch
- Provides consistent build environment

## D) Git Safety & Normalization

### .gitattributes
- Normalizes line endings to LF
- Properly handles binary files
- Prevents line ending conflicts

### Binary File Handling
```
*.png binary
*.jpg binary
*.pdf binary
*.ico binary
*.gif binary
*.svg binary
*.woff binary
*.woff2 binary
*.ttf binary
*.eot binary
*.otf binary
```

## E) Testing & Verification

### Local Testing Commands
```bash
# Test health check
./scripts/healthcheck.sh

# Test pre-push guard
npm run prepush:guard

# Test type checking
npm run typecheck

# Test Expo setup
npx expo-doctor
```

### Expected Results
- Health check: ✅ No critical issues detected
- Pre-push guard: Should pass before allowing push
- Type check: May show TypeScript errors (expected)
- Expo doctor: Should show no blocking issues

## F) Branch Protection Recommendations

### GitHub Repository Settings
1. **Require PRs** for main branch
2. **Require status checks** to pass before merge
3. **Require 1 review** minimum
4. **Disable force pushes** on protected branches
5. **Disable deletions** on protected branches

### Status Checks
- CI workflow must pass
- Health checks must pass

## G) Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Sparse Files (macOS)
- **Symptom**: Files showing 0 blocks but >0 bytes
- **Cause**: APFS file system behavior
- **Solution**: Health check now focuses on critical issues, not sparse files

#### Husky Deprecation Warnings
- **Symptom**: "DEPRECATED" warnings in pre-push
- **Solution**: Updated to modern husky format

#### TypeScript Errors
- **Symptom**: Many type errors during typecheck
- **Status**: Expected - code needs type fixes
- **Impact**: Doesn't block pushes currently

### Health Check Failures
1. **Critical files missing**: Check file paths and permissions
2. **Git integrity issues**: Run `git fsck --full` manually
3. **Large files**: Review if files >10MB are necessary

## H) Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
1. **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Gradually fix type errors
2. **Test Coverage**: Add Jest/Testing Library
3. **Linting**: Add ESLint and Prettier
4. **Security Scanning**: Add npm audit to CI
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Add bundle size checks

### Monitoring
- Review CI results regularly
- Monitor health check output
- Track TypeScript error count over time

## I) Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Update dependencies monthly
- Review and update health check criteria
- Monitor CI pipeline performance
- Clean up git history if needed

### Health Check Updates
- Modify `scripts/healthcheck.sh` as needed
- Update critical file list
- Adjust file size thresholds

---

## Summary
This implementation provides:
- ✅ Automated health checks before pushes
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline for all changes
- ✅ Git integrity monitoring
- ✅ Critical file validation
- ✅ Large file detection
- ✅ Line ending normalization
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation

The system is designed to catch issues early while being practical for macOS development environments.
